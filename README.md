# Syzygy code test
The task is to create a simple crime map.
## Description
Here at Syzygy we like to be on the safe side when we go out, better safe than sorry...

The task is to plot crime data from the [UK police API](https://data.police.uk/) on a map of your choice. Use any of the `Crime Related` API endpoints.

This should take around 3-4 hours so please don't spend excessive amount of time on it.

The only stipulation is that you build your solution in JavaScript.

Don't worry about styling, we're more interested in correct functionality and the quality of the code.

## Specification
* it should initially show the data around Syzygy office.
* is should only show data for the previous month.
* it should display a description of the crime for each one of them.
* it should allow users to change the location.
* write about further improvements you would make to your solution if you were given more time.
